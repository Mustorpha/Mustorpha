# 👨‍💻 Mustorpha Jamiu – Software Engineer

Welcome. I’m a Software Engineer with a deep interest in building **distributed systems**, **intelligent applications**, and **resilient cloud-native architectures**. I specialize in designing and implementing software that operates reliably at scale across industries and domains, from mission-critical APIs to offline-first data pipelines and ML-integrated workflows.

## 🧠 What I Do

### 🏗️ Architecture & System Design
- Design **modular, loosely coupled microservices** for scalability and agility  
- Architect **polyglot persistence solutions** using SQL, NoSQL, and search engines  
- Implement patterns like **CQRS**, **event-driven processing**, **retry orchestration**, **graceful degradation** and **more**

### ⚙️ Performance & Reliability Engineering
- Optimize **long-running processes**, thread-constrained workloads, and I/O-heavy systems  
- Build **parallelizable tools** for efficient data transformations and API orchestration  
- Stress-test APIs and subsystems using tools like **JMeter** under real-world concurrency models

### ☁️ Cloud-Native & Asynchronous Systems
- Design **resilient infrastructure** using Azure: Functions, Service Bus, App Services, VMs  
- Enable **offline sync**, **event buffering**, and **observability-first** designs  
- Integrate **messaging queues, caching layers**, and **stateless services** into fault-tolerant platforms

### 🤖 Intelligent & Autonomous Systems (AI/ML-Aware)
- Build systems that interoperate with **machine learning pipelines** and intelligent agents  
- Architect workflows where **AI augments automation**, not replaces clarity  
- Design for traceability, auditability, and controlled rollout of ML-based features

### ➕ And More...

## 📌 Representative Areas of Work

- 🔁 **Distributed processing engine** for parallel task execution using queues + async APIs  
- 💡 **Domain-agnostic microservice architecture** with multi-tenant awareness  
- 📊 **Dynamic report generation** systems with query optimization at scale  
- 🤖 **Data pipelines that feed or consume machine learning models** in production  
- 🌍 **Cross-system orchestration layer** for syncing external systems with guaranteed consistency

## 🧭 Engineering Principles I Live By

- 🧠 **Think in systems** – Code is just one piece of a larger puzzle  
- 📐 **Design for clarity** – Clean abstractions beat cleverness  
- 🔒 **Build for resilience** – Expect timeouts, retries, chaos  
- 🔁 **Favor feedback loops** – Logging, metrics, tests, humans-in-the-loop  
- 🌐 **Stay adaptive** – Domains change, systems evolve, keep learning
